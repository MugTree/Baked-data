# Baked data idea üçû

Simple idea to allow a small database to be baked into an application

- Single .exe
- Useful for situtations where you only really need to read from the DB.
- Only one file to upload
- Runs on serverless (should do)

For example: a simple affiliate site you could do the click logging through JS.

# Instructions

1. make create-db

   creates the schema and inserts some rows

2. make run-app

   creates and runs the binary

3. visit localhost:3000
